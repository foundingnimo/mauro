# Mauro backlog

This backlog records product improvements that are not complete. The order is
intentional. Finish the safety and handoff foundations before adding broad
automation.

Status values:

- `Now`: active work or the next implementation slice.
- `Next`: high-value work after the current safety layer.
- `Later`: useful work that depends on earlier foundations.

## Now

### Expedition dogfood follow-ups

- [ ] Make mapper isolation enforceable on hosts that ignore agent tool
  restrictions.
- [ ] Verify that a clean Expedition cannot reuse old generated Navigator names.
- [ ] Remove duplicated decision blocks from host-rendered command responses.
- [x] Re-run the large-monorepo Map gate with validated reports and compare its
  capability boundaries with the rejected draft.
- [ ] Keep preliminary Navigators isolated from host discovery until a person
  approves and publishes their capability boundaries.
- [ ] Prevent mapper shell commands from writing repository files, or detect
  and reject every write before synthesis.
- [ ] Add a resumable Expedition checkpoint after validated surveys so an
  interrupted gate does not repeat the expensive scan.

### Consistent multi-session reads

Goal: Let several coding-agent sessions use one repository without losing Mauro
state or performing overlapping work by accident.

- [ ] Permit concurrent readers while keeping multi-file state reads consistent.
- [ ] Detect a changed Git baseline before a Voyage writes curated context.
- [ ] Define behavior for separate local users, Git worktrees, and remote hosts.

### Navigator coverage checks

- [ ] Find maintained paths with no Navigator.
- [ ] Find excessive or contradictory Navigator overlap.
- [ ] Flag broad descriptions, weak evidence, and unapproved boundaries.
- [ ] Surface these findings through `mauro check` and `mauro next`.

## Next

### Additional lifecycle adapters

- [ ] Add native lifecycle adapters for hosts that expose safe hook APIs.
- [ ] Keep task-boundary reconciliation as the portable fallback.
- [ ] Verify adapter behavior without changing canonical repository state.

### Learn from completed Voyages

- [ ] Compare predicted impact with the files that changed.
- [ ] Record missed paths, unnecessary Navigator selections, and missing checks.
- [ ] Propose Map improvements from repeated misses.
- [ ] Require approval before changing a capability boundary.

### Continuous integration mode

- [ ] Add a non-interactive `mauro check --ci` contract.
- [ ] Detect stale generated views, suspect binding documents, incomplete
  Navigator coverage, and Map drift.
- [ ] Produce concise annotations for pull-request systems.

### Session handoff packets

- [ ] Record the objective, Voyage ID, completed work, remaining work, changed
  paths, decisions, failed approaches, checks, and Navigators.
- [ ] Let another session resume without reading the original transcript.
- [ ] Keep raw transcripts and chain-of-thought out of durable state.

### Safer merge behavior

- [ ] Split frequently edited machine state where this reduces conflicts.
- [ ] Keep generated JSON deterministic and consistently ordered.
- [ ] Detect state generated from a different Git baseline.
- [ ] Regenerate derived files instead of asking a person to merge them.

### Evaluation fixtures

- [ ] Add awkward monorepos with duplicated code, misplaced documents, generated
  trees, ignored knowledge, and ambiguous ownership.
- [ ] Measure mapping accuracy, ticket-to-Navigator selection, stale-document
  detection, false positives, and context size.
- [ ] Turn each confirmed failure into a regression fixture.

### Expedition Tool Gap provenance

- [ ] Let an Expedition stage structured Tool Gap observations before a Voyage
  exists.
- [ ] Use the approved Expedition Chronicle as provenance.
- [ ] Preserve the existing cross-Voyage promotion threshold; one Expedition
  must not promote its own reported gaps.

### Shared findings and community voting

Goal: Let people share selected Mauro findings so other Mauro installations
can discover existing suggestions, add independent evidence, and vote on what
should be improved or built next.

- [ ] Define one shareable proposal envelope for repository findings, Mauro
  improvement candidates, and Toolbox Tool Gap requests.
- [ ] Make publication opt-in for each repository and each proposal. Never
  upload a local finding, vote, or evidence without explicit authorization.
- [ ] Remove repository names, private origins, absolute paths, tickets, code,
  logs, credentials, secrets, customer data, and other identifying evidence
  before publication.
- [ ] Let a Mauro installation query relevant published proposals and show
  existing suggestions before it creates a duplicate.
- [ ] Deduplicate equivalent proposals with stable public keys while preserving
  independent occurrence counts and version or host compatibility evidence.
- [ ] Support useful votes such as `needed`, `seen-again`, `not-relevant`, and
  `resolved`, with enough provenance to resist accidental vote inflation.
- [ ] Let shared demand promote recurring Tool Gaps into candidate Toolbox
  operations without installing or executing community code automatically.
- [ ] Keep local findings authoritative until a person chooses to share, merge,
  dismiss, withdraw, or mark a proposal resolved.
- [ ] Define moderation, abuse reporting, proposal ownership, withdrawal,
  retention, and deletion behavior before enabling public discovery.
- [ ] Evaluate a GitHub-backed registry first, then a provider-neutral service
  only if cross-host discovery and voting need more than GitHub can provide.

## Later

### Background service evaluation

- [ ] Evaluate a long-running watcher after task-boundary reconciliation has
  production evidence; it must not rescan continuously or race other writers.
- [ ] Add an MCP adapter only when it offers capability beyond the shared skill
  and CLI, and test it against the supported protocol versions.

### Map quality metrics

- [ ] Report coverage, approved and preliminary capabilities, unowned paths,
  overlap, low-confidence relationships, and stale context.
- [ ] Show the metrics in `mauro status` without reducing architecture quality to
  one misleading score.

### Repository-specific verification catalog

- [ ] Let each Navigator declare the checks for its capability.
- [ ] Verify that each declared command still exists.
- [ ] Select the smallest sufficient check set from the actual change.
- [ ] Never claim that a check passed without observed output.

### Pull-request context

- [ ] Add responsible Navigators, Charter constraints, document state, and
  observed verification to the bounded pull-request block.
- [ ] Keep every external pull-request write behind explicit authorization.

## Completed

### Focused task briefing

  matches.
- [x] Bound responsible capabilities and explicit review expansion.
- [x] Narrow likely paths, supporting documents, and proposed verification to
  the task while preserving all applicable Instruction Contracts.
- [x] Add a large-monorepo regression based on the direct-debit application and
  marketplace API dogfood task.

### Validated Expedition survey handoff

- [x] Define one stable report contract for structure, capability,
  documentation, and duplication surveys.
- [x] Add a read-only validator for JSON shape, role, baseline, paths, globs,
  confidence, Tool Gaps, report size, and deterministic coverage.

  until all four reports validate.
- [x] Prevent bundled survey agents and the synthesizer from nested delegation.
- [x] Keep pre-publication document discovery on the deterministic Map instead
  of the manifest-backed documentation index.
- [x] Tell capability mapping to ignore existing generated Navigator names.

### Ambient and provider-neutral operation

- [x] Split automatic `mauro-context` behavior from explicit `mauro`
  administration.
- [x] Initialize, reconcile, and brief through the ambient skill at task
  boundaries.
- [x] Keep Claude Code hooks, path rules, and specialist project agents.

  migrate the legacy Claude runtime.
- [x] Add adapter and repository-migration health to `mauro doctor`.

### Upstream contribution loop

- [x] Keep Mauro improvement candidates in private user state outside target
  repositories and the installed runtime.
- [x] Detect and deduplicate verified Mauro limitations during ambient work.

  refusal.
- [x] Ask for and pin one exact canonical Git branch during init, report its
  status, and guard document trust and Voyage lifecycle changes.

### Compact ticket briefing

- [x] Add `/mauro brief "<ticket>"` with responsible and reviewing Navigators,
  likely paths, active knowledge, Charter constraints, dependencies, suspect
  documents, and exact verification.
- [x] Provide concise text and stable JSON output.
- [x] Keep ticket-provider integration outside the deterministic core.
