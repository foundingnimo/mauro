# Pull-request context workflow

Pull-request context is a bounded review aid. It is not a knowledge source.

## Commands

- `pr preview`: Generate context locally. Do not change the pull request.
- `pr update`: Replace the generated block after external-write authorization.
- `pr check`: Compare the block head marker with the current pull-request head.
- `pr reviewers`: List responsible Navigators and unresolved ownership.

## Source range

Generate context from the pull-request merge-base and head. Do not summarize the
full repository or an unrelated working tree.

Run a Bearing check before generation.

## Required block

Use these markers:

```text
<!-- MAURO:START head=<commit> -->
<!-- MAURO:END -->
```

Replace only content between markers. Preserve all human-authored pull-request
text outside the block.

Include only:

- Affected capabilities
- Primary Navigator and required reviews
- Important rationale
- Relevant active knowledge
- Charter constraints
- Architecture impact
- Documentation state
- Bearing-check result
- New or superseded knowledge
- Unresolved risks

Maximum 250 words. Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English.

Exclude raw transcripts, routine details, irrelevant history, full task logs,
secrets, hidden reasoning, and exhaustive file lists.

If the head commit changes, mark the previous block suspect until regeneration.
