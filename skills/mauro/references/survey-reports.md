# Expedition survey reports

Each first-run survey returns one JSON object. The parent agent stores the
object in its own file and validates it before synthesis. A survey agent must
not delegate or write a shared report file.

## Common envelope

Every report contains:

- `schema_version`: `1`.
- `role`: `structure`, `capability`, `documentation`, or `duplication`.
- `baseline.commit`: `.mauro/map.json` → `baseline.commit`.
- `baseline.config_digest`: `.mauro/fingerprints.json` → `config_digest`.
- `baseline.map_generated_at`: `.mauro/map.json` → `generated_at`.
- `summary`: one short summary.
- `findings`: semantic findings.
- `unresolved`: unresolved findings.
- `tool_gaps`: structured Tool Gap observations.

Each finding and unresolved item contains `kind`, `summary`, `evidence`, and a
`confidence` number from 0 to 1. Evidence contains exact repository-relative
paths. A Tool Gap uses the fields defined in the Toolbox reference.

Use stable lowercase identifiers with hyphens. Exact paths must stay inside
the repository. Path patterns can use literal text, `*`, `**`, and `?`. Do not
use brace or character-class globs.

## Role payloads

The structure report contains `units`, `dependencies`, `entrypoints`, and
`tests`:

- A unit contains `id`, `name`, `root`, `purpose`, `evidence`, and
  `confidence`. It covers one deterministic Map unit ID.
- A dependency contains `from`, `to`, `kind`, `evidence`, and `confidence`.
- An entrypoint or test contains `path`, `unit`, `purpose`, `evidence`, and
  `confidence`.

The capability report contains `capabilities`. A capability contains `id`,
`name`, `purpose`, `units`, `primary_paths`, `secondary_paths`, `evidence`, and
`confidence`. The `units` arrays must assign every deterministic Map unit
exactly once.

The documentation report contains `documents` and `instruction_contracts`:

- A document contains `id`, `path`, `classification`, `criticality`, `claims`,
  `watches`, `evidence`, and `confidence`. It covers one path from
  `map.documents`, except a path recorded separately as an Instruction
  Contract.
- An Instruction Contract contains `id`, `path`, `providers`, `scope`,
  `parent`, `precedence`, `evidence`, and `confidence`. It preserves the stable
  identifiers from `map.instruction_contracts`.

The duplication report contains `duplicate_groups`. A group contains `kind`,
at least two `paths`, `evidence`, and `confidence`.

The schema is in `schemas/survey-report.schema.json`. The deterministic
validator performs the stricter repository-baseline and coverage checks.

## Handoff to synthesis

Use one caller-owned path for each top-level role. For example:

```text
.mauro/drafts/<expedition-id>/surveys/structure.json
.mauro/drafts/<expedition-id>/surveys/capability.json
.mauro/drafts/<expedition-id>/surveys/documentation.json
.mauro/drafts/<expedition-id>/surveys/duplication.json
```

Run the matching validation after the parent stores each report:

```text
mauro tool run survey-report-validate \
  --role capability \
  --file .mauro/drafts/<expedition-id>/surveys/capability.json \
  --json
```

An invalid result exits with failure and lists all detected problems. Ask only
the responsible survey agent to correct its return. Do not synthesize until
all four results are valid. Keep draft files out of publication and commits.
